        <h1>Nice to meet you!</h1>
        <p>I'm Nik, an engineering and culture fiend.</p>
        <p>I have a million different hobbies and passions that allow me to love both the outdoors and the indoors.</p>
        <p>Currently, I'm most fascinated by web development (hence this site), philosophy, cross-country skiing, and yoga.</p>
        <p>Professionally, I develop industrial automation systems, which means that I write code, play with electronics, and design mechanical assemblies, all under the premise of improving manufaturing efficiency and quality. I have enjoyed time working in the domains of mail, aerospace, video routing, medical robotics, management consulting, and photonics.</p>
